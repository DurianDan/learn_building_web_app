1. I don't have experience with tensorflow, and haven't build any Tensorflow project

2. I plan to take the exam after 8 months from now. I plan to use books and online courses. I have identified 2 resources: first is the book: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"; and second is a Coursera course: "DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate"

3. I can devote myself 4 hours each weak. I'm currently working as a Data Analyst from 8:30 to 17:45 from Monday to Friday.

4. I don't know what specific area of Tensorflow that i'm lacking.  I'm have basic understanding of Linear Algegra, Calculus, I have applied OOP in some of my tasks at work, and I have build a NLP project using tf-idf, K-means clustering with sklearn.
